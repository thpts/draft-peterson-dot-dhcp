1.  Introduction

   DHCPv4 [RFC2131], DHCPv6 [RFC3646], and IPv6 Router Announcements
   [RFC8106] all provide means to inform clients of available resolvers
   using the incumbent DNS protocol for querying, however there is no
   means of specifying alternate protocols to perform DNS queries.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   "DoT", "Do53" and other related abbreviations follow the definitions
   as defined in [I-D.draft-hoffman-dns-terminology-ter-01].

3.  The DNS over TLS Option

   The DoT DHCP/RA option informs the client that a DoT service is
   available for use for answering DNS queries using the same IP
   address(es) returned in Do53 DNS Server DHCP/RA options.  Thus
   networks which announce DoT services MUST announce DNS resolver
   availability via their respective options, and provide a TLS
   certificate on the DoT service which passes verification ([RFC6125])
   against the DNS Host Name provided in the DoT DHCP/RA option.

   The maximum length of the DNS Host Name that can be carried in IPv4
   DHCP is 255 bytes, so DNS Host Names longer than 255 bytes SHOULD NOT
   be used in IPv6 DHCP or IPv6 RA.

3.4.  Trust Anchoring

   TODO: Put in considerations for using DANE and/or existing
   certificate authorities for trust anchoring.

4.  Security Considerations

   An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages could include
   this option and present a malicious resolver.

   TODO: Further risk and threat assessments.

5.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: This section must be updated after assignments have been
   issued.

   This document requires the assignment of an option code assigned
   under the "BOOTP Vendor Extensions and DHCP Options"
   [bootp-registry], in addition to an option code assigned under the
   "Option Codes" registry under DHCPv6 parameters [dhcpv6-registry].

   Also, an assignment for an IPv6 RA Option Type from the "IPv6
   Neighbor Discovery Option Formats" registry under ICMPv6 paramters
   [icmpv6-registry].
